Just walked out of the theater, and wow, Bring Her Back is swirling around in my head like socks in a dryer. My feelings? Somewhere between that was mind-blowing and what on earth did I just watch? Like, seriously. I’m tired, slightly cranky maybe, cause the sun is setting and my stomach's growling. But that ending... it's like that stubborn eyelash you can’t ignore, just hanging around in your peripheral vision.

The film was kind of like assembling IKEA furniture without a manual — you think you know what's coming, and then you’re knee-deep in a jumble of bits and pieces that seem to mean something profound, though geez if I know what. Don’t get me wrong, some parts hit like an unexpected hailstorm, suddenly there and riveting, but others were like waiting for your coffee order in a high traffic cafe with slow Wi-Fi. Did that make sense? I don’t even know anymore.

> There's this scene where the protagonist just stares at a flickering light bulb until I started doubting if it was symbolic or if the budget just didn’t cover a new one. Honestly, it felt prophetic, like my brain trying to process working at the call center and what, exactly, my purpose is other than saying, “Hello, how can I help you?”

The actors? Think of mismatched socks, colorful, eclectic, almost charming in their chaos. They were so believable one moment, and then, suddenly, it was like they got lost in their own lines. Wait, should I just download this or recommend it over coffee?” maybe standing in the line at Starbucks feels like a better place for that question.

Random brain moment: for some reason, while the protagonist was having a deep, defining moment, I imagined a cat chasing a laser pointer, ceaselessly, pointlessly chasing and never quite getting there. Hopeless, maybe, in a funny way?

By the way, whoever did the sound editing should get an award or something, it felt like a rhythm etched into my bones, but there’s a chance it was just the theater's crummy acoustics added to it too.

def findHer(movie):
    if movie == Bring Her Back:
        return Adventure ensues!
    else:
        return Try another title.
```

Okay, I’m rambling. In short, watch the movie — or, you know, don’t. Download it later when you’ve got the time to lose yourself in a plot that feels (delightfully?) tangled. Just be ready for the fact that you might find yourself asking more questions than when you started, like when you try to brainstorm new customer service protocols minus the endless complaint calls.
